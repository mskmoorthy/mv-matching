"""
Maximum cardinality matching in general graphs.

This module implements the general matching algorithm given in "The General 
Maximum Matching Algorithm of Micali and Vazirani" by Paul A. Peterson and 
Michael C. Loui, Algorithmica, 1988. 

Many terms used in the code comments are explained in the paper by Peterson
and Loui. The paper could prove necessary in making sense of this code.

    """Compute a maximum cardinality matching in a general graph G.
    
    A matching is a subset of edges in which no node occurs more than once.
    The cardinality of a matching is the number of matched edges.
    The maximum matching is a matching of maximum cardinality.
    
    :param G - the NetworkX graph given
        Undirected graph.
        
    :return mate - dictionary
        The matching is returned as a dictionary such that
        mate[v] == w if node v is matched to node w. Unmatched
        nodes do not occur as a key in mate.
        
    :notes
    This function takes time O(sqrt(number_of_nodes) * number_of_edges).
    
    This method is based on the "blossom" method for finding augmenting
    paths.
